# Setup

This is what you need to install:

 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) v6 or higher

Then open a shell and clone the repository to your local machine.

To ensure everything is working, run this command from the root of the repository:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies, compile the library source and run the suite of tests.
